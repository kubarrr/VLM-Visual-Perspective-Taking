## Abstract 
We present the results of an academic project focused on enhancing visual perspective-taking abilities in VisionLanguage Models (VLMs). We replicate the APC-VLM (Attribute-Partitioned
Concept Vision-Language Model) framework, originally designed to simulate
human-like mental transformations of
scenes via abstract 3D representations.
Our implementation reproduces the original pipeline, including object detection, segmentation, depth estimation, coordinate transformation and numerical
prompts. We evaluate proposed method
on our own specially prepared dataset,
designed for assessing allocentric reasoning. This paper summarizes the full implementation process, experimental setup,
observed limitations and resulting insights
into VLM capabilities in spatial reasoning.
