## Abstract 
We present the results of an academic project focused on enhancing visual perspective-taking abilities in Vision Language Models (VLMs). We replicate the APC-VLM (Attribute-Partitioned
Concept Vision-Language Model) framework, originally designed to simulate
human-like mental transformations of
scenes via abstract 3D representations.
Our implementation reproduces the original pipeline, including object detection, segmentation, depth estimation, coordinate transformation and numerical
prompts. We evaluate proposed method
on our own specially prepared dataset,
designed for assessing allocentric reasoning. This paper summarizes the full implementation process, experimental setup,
observed limitations and resulting insights
into VLM capabilities in spatial reasoning.
